celery-prometheus-exporter
==========================

celery-prometheus-exporter is a little exporter for Celery related metrics in
order to get picked up by Prometheus. As with other exporters like
mongodb\_exporter or node\_exporter this has been implemented as a
standalone-service to make reuse easier across different frameworks.

So far it provides access to the following metrics:

* ``celery_tasks`` exposes the number of tasks currently known to the queue
  seperated by ``state`` (RUNNING, STARTED, ...).
* ``celery_workers`` exposes the number of currently probably alive workers
* ``celery_task_latency`` exposes a histogram of task latency, i.e. the time until
  tasks are picked up by a worker


How to use
==========

There are multiple ways to install this. The obvious one is using ``pip install
celery-prometheus-exporter`` and then using the ``celery-prometheus-exporter``
command::

  $ celery-prometheus-exporter
  Starting HTTPD on 0.0.0.0:8888

This package only depends on Celery directly, so you will have to install
whatever other dependencies you will need for it to speak with your broker ðŸ™‚

Celery workers have to be configured to send task-related events:
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/configuration.html#worker-send-task-events.

Alternatively, you can use the bundle Makefile and Dockerfile to generate a
Docker image.

If you want the HTTPD to listen to another port, use the ``--addr`` option.

By default, this will expect the broker to be available through
``redis://redis:6379/0``. If you're using AMQP or something else other than
Redis, take a look at the Celery documentation and install the additioinal
requirements ðŸ˜Š Also use the ``--broker`` option to specify a different broker
URL.


If you need to pass additional options to your brokers transport use the
``--transport_options``  option. It tries to read a dict from a JSON object.
E.g. to set your master name when using Redis Sentinel for broker discovery:
``--transport_options '{"master_name": "mymaster"}'``

If you need to pass additional options to your broker's transport use the
``--transport-options``  option. It tries to read a dict from a JSON object.
E.g. to set your master name when using Redis Sentinel for broker discovery:
``--transport-options '{"master_name": "mymaster"}'``

Use ``--tz`` to specify the timezone the Celery app is using. Otherwise the
systems local time will be used.


If you then look at the exposed metrics, you should see something like this::

  $ http get http://localhost:8888/metrics | grep celery_

  # TYPE celery_workers gauge
  celery_workers 1.0

  celery_task_latency_sum 0.0


Limitations
===========

* Among tons of other features celery-prometheus-exporter doesn't support stats
  for multiple queues. As far as I can tell, only the routing key is exposed
  through the events API which might be enough to figure out the final queue,
  though.
* This has only been tested with Redis so far.
